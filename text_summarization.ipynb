It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa.

Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat.

I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme.

During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1.

The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

      "\n",
      "Kalam shared a memorable question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020, which inspired him and stuck with him. The speech was a reflection on his experiences and interactions during his tenure, and he elaborated on each of the 10 key messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker acknowledged and appreciated the question, calling it thoughtful, and assured that the person's dream would be considered at the highest national level and that they would work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the aspirations of India's youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India by 2020. The President shares his experience of visiting a village in Nagaland, where he saw empowered village councils functioning effectively. He highlights the need for physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products from villages to markets. The President then talks about the Periyar Maniammai College's initiative, Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA), which has connected 65 villages and generated employment and entrepreneurship opportunities by providing physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity. The speech aims to inspire the youth to contribute to the nation's development by empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker highlights the success of a rural development model, Periyar PURA, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through self-help groups, cultivation, and other activities like power generation and food processing. The project has collaborated with experts from Japan to develop internationally competitive products. The speaker notes that similar models are being replicated in other states and suggests that 7000 such models are needed to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shared two enriching experiences. Firstly, they met over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories, who showed great interest in various gardens at Rashtriya Bhavan and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources and improve farmers' economic conditions. They expressed confidence that the nation can achieve a 4% annual growth in agricultural GDP through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker shared a heartwarming experience of meeting a person named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs, but had a radiant and happy face. Despite his physical disability, Krishna Murthy expressed gratitude to those who helped him and wanted to sing in front of the speaker, showing his positivity and determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the given speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker recounts two inspiring stories. The first is about a physically challenged person who, despite his disability, has developed a talent for music through perseverance and positive attitude, and has even performed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The second story is about the resilience of the people of Jammu & Kashmir, particularly the villagers of Urusa, who were recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker praises the villagers for their courage and determination in overcoming their challenges, and commends the role of the Army and Air Force in providing relief and aid. The overall message is one of inspiration and the power of human spirit to overcome adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker reflects on the courage and resilience of people in the face of natural disasters. They recount their visit to a village affected by an earthquake, where they witnessed the community's bravery and the efforts of the authorities to provide relief. The speaker also shares their experience of visiting Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Tsunami, where they were inspired by the islanders' courage and sense of community. The islanders had taken in affected victims as their own children, eliminating the need for orphanages. The speaker composed a poem, \"Sea Waves\", to capture the islanders' spirit, which they sang together with the community. The speech highlights the importance of courage, community, and connectivity in transforming society in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at a cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 super specialty hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been launched in Ethiopia, with Indian institutions partnering with African ones to provide services such as an MBA course and tele-medicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker highlights three main points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Technological advancements and international cooperation**: Hyderabad is providing live tele-consultation to doctors in Africa, and the Pan African network is connecting the heads of state of 53 countries. The speaker is happy that Indian experience has enabled societal transformation in Africa.\n",
      "2. **National pride and defense**: The speaker expresses pride in the Indian Defense Forces, citing personal experiences visiting KUMAR in Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and flying in a Sukhoi-30 fighter.

      "3. **Youth empowerment**: The speaker mentions a meeting with citizens in Hyderabad who are working to transform youth into enlightened citizens through the Lead India 2020 Foundation, as part of the vision for a Developed India 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech highlights India's achievements in technology, defense, and youth empowerment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the positive impact of the Lead India 2020 Foundation's training program on the youth, particularly in Andhra Pradesh. The program, in partnership with the District Administration, has transformed thousands of students by instilling self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker cites an example of a student leader who influenced her father to quit smoking after attending the training camp. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering the youth through value-based education and leadership, considering them the most powerful resource in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker reflects on the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage while pursuing economic growth.

The speaker quotes a poem, emphasizing that with great aims, the youth can achieve their targets. They then outline a vision for a developed India by 2020, characterized by: reduced rural-urban divide, equitable access to energy and water, harmony among agriculture, industry, and service sectors, education with value systems for all meritorious candidates, and India being a hub for top talent, scholars, scientists, and investors. The speaker calls upon citizens to work together to realize this vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes a vision for a nation that is prosperous, healthy, and happy, with key characteristics including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Good healthcare for all\n",

He recalled a memorable question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become developed by 2020, which resonated with him. He noted that her sentiment was echoed by over 1.5 million youth he had met, representing the aspirations of the nation's 540 million young people. He also shared examples of empowered villages, such as Khuza ma village in Nagaland, and initiatives like the Periyar PURA complex in Tanjore, which provided urban amenities to 65 rural villages, generating employment and entrepreneurship. The Periyar PURA complex has been a success, with 1000 self-help groups supporting the creation of entrepreneurs, 200 acres of wasteland being developed into cultivable land, and the production of internationally competitive prototypes for lifestyle products in collaboration with Japanese experts. Kalam envisioned the need for 7000 PURA complexes across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, and noted that similar initiatives were being established in many states.\n",
